Hi, I'm PÃ¤r. I'm a fiddling mathematician who programs and writes about it every now and then. I use this website to collect my thoughts, tutorials made for me to remember how I did stuff, and just as a means to document what I'm doing and not doing.

Right now I'm experimenting with Python, Numpy, Pandas, Electron, Node.js and a lot of other stuff as well. Hope you enjoy what I do, and if you do, feel free to get in touch! If you want to contact me you'll find my homes on social media to the left. Just send me a DM on Twitter or Instagram and I'll get back to you.
